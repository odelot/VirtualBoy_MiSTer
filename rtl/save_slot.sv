// Backup-RAM save slot controller for one MiSTer virtual disk image.
//
// Tracks the mounted image size, schedules load/save transfers against the
// HPS block interface, and turns cartridge SRAM dirty pulses into pending
// autosaves that run when the OSD opens. A save started while unmounted
// creates a full-size image so the HPS side allocates the file.
